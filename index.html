    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Abhilash, a bibliophile with a deep passion for personal growth. I explore the world through books and curiosity.
      A tech enthusiast, fitness lover, and budding entrepreneur, I enjoy working out and thinking deeply about the meaning of life.
      Interested in finance and startups, I believe in creating value from scratch.
      Recently, I shared my journey at Unmaad & IMD – <a href="https://youtu.be/ErLiy-eEIus" target="_blank">watch here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration in Digital Business and Entrepreneurship at IIM Bangalore (IMB-DBE). Previously, I joined ExIIM University but decided to drop out to focus on my current degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've attended multiple TEDx events, including the second and third editions of TEDx Revenge. During my internship at Downtown Doghouse Media, I played a crucial role in the Founder's Office, starting as a Business Development Associate and later taking on responsibilities in sales, marketing, and HR. I led projects from marketing apps to overall project leadership and received a Letter of Recommendation for my contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was offered the opportunity to co-found "Nothing But Fruit," a frozen fruit brand aimed at providing nourishing fruits without artificial ingredients. Due to other commitments, I chose not to pursue this venture. I'm a startup enthusiast eager to deliver more value in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.
